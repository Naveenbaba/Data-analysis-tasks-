TASK-5 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Description

This task involves performing exploratory data analysis to understand the structure, distribution, and relationships within the dataset. Various statistical methods and visualizations are used to uncover insights and patterns.

Key Steps

üìã Data Overview Used .describe(), .info(), and .value_counts() to understand data types, missing values, and distribution of categorical variables. üìä Data Visualization Created visualizations using: sns.pairplot() to observe pairwise relationships sns.heatmap() to show correlations between variables Histograms, boxplots, and scatterplots to analyze distributions and outliers üîç Trend & Relationship Analysis Identified key relationships between variables (e.g., sales vs. profit, discount impact) Detected patterns, outliers, and correlations üìù Observations & Summary Wrote brief insights for each visual Provided a summary of overall findings to guide further analysis and decision-making Tools Used

Python (Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib)

TASK-6 Time-Based Sales Analysis (SQL)

Description

This task focuses on analyzing sales data over time using SQL queries. The goal is to extract monthly and yearly trends in revenue and order volume to support business planning and forecasting.

Key SQL Operations

Date Extraction: Used EXTRACT(MONTH FROM order_date) to group data by month. Grouping: Grouped sales data by year and month using GROUP BY. Revenue Calculation: Used SUM() to calculate total monthly revenue. Order Volume: Used COUNT(DISTINCT order_id) to calculate total number of unique orders. Sorting: Applied ORDER BY to sort results chronologically. Time Filtering: Limited results to specific time periods for focused analysis. Tools Used

SQL (PostgreSQL)

TASK-7 Description

This task demonstrates how to connect a SQLite database to Python, run SQL queries, and visualize the results using pandas and matplotlib. The goal is to analyze total quantity sold and revenue generated per product.

Key Steps

Connected to sales_data.db using sqlite3 Ran a SQL query to calculate total quantity and revenue per product Loaded query results into a pandas DataFrame Displayed results using print() Plotted a bar chart of product revenue using matplotlib Tools Used

Python (sqlite3, pandas, matplotlib) Postgresql Database
