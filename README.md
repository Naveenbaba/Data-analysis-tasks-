TASK-5 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Description

This task involves performing exploratory data analysis to understand the structure, distribution, and relationships within the dataset. Various statistical methods and visualizations are used to uncover insights and patterns.

Key Steps

üìã Data Overview Used .describe(), .info(), and .value_counts() to understand data types, missing values, and distribution of categorical variables. üìä Data Visualization Created visualizations using: sns.pairplot() to observe pairwise relationships sns.heatmap() to show correlations between variables Histograms, boxplots, and scatterplots to analyze distributions and outliers üîç Trend & Relationship Analysis Identified key relationships between variables (e.g., sales vs. profit, discount impact) Detected patterns, outliers, and correlations üìù Observations & Summary Wrote brief insights for each visual Provided a summary of overall findings to guide further analysis and decision-making Tools Used

Python (Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib)
